# Homework

All homework assignments must be submitted in your own `homework`
repository, in a separate directories named according to the name of the
homework (e.g., `01_values`).

To create this repository, click [here][Classroom].

[Classroom]: https://classroom.github.com/a/66Y9VWKv

To upload a directory using GitHub's web interface, click on the `+`
button (to the left of the green `Code` button), choose the
`Upload files` option, select the directory you wish to upload, and
click on `Commit changes`. Alternatively, you can drag-and-drop your
folder in the web page.

If successfully, you should see the directory appear in the repository.
